            its internal business purposes. If a Customer Affiliate enters a separate
            Order Form with Provider, the Customer’s Affiliate creates a separate
            agreement between Provider and that Affiliate, where Provider’s responsibility
            to the Affiliate is individual and separate from Customer and Customer
            is not responsible for its Affiliates’ agreement.

            services, including third-party components of the Product, and
            Customer authorizes Provider to process its Usage Data and Customer
            Content for such purposes. However, (a) Usage Data and Customer
            Content must be aggregated before it can be used for these purposes,
            and (b) Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts consistent
            with industry standard technology to de-identify Usage Data and
            Customer Content before such use. Nothing in this section will
            reduce or limit Provider’s obligations regarding Personal Data that
            may be contained in Usage Data or Customer Content under Applicable
            Data Protection Laws. Due to the nature of artificial intelligence

            Claim that contains an admission of fault or otherwise materially
            and adversely impacts the Protected Party without the prior written
