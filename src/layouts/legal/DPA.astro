            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              Openlane operates on Google Cloud Platform (GCP), leveraging its ISO 27001, SOC 2, and PCI DSS–certified infrastructure. Our production systems run in Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) clusters designed for high availability and fault tolerance.
              Security controls include network segmentation, private service access, firewall rules, role-based access control (RBAC), and continuous vulnerability management. We use Cloudflare for CDN, WAF, and DDoS protection, enhancing availability and resilience. Access to all systems is governed by Google Workspace SSO with enforced MFA and least-privilege principles. Encryption, configuration management, and audit logging are enforced at multiple layers of the stack.

            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              Customer data is stored in Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL) databases configured for high availability with automatic failover and a disaster recovery replica in a separate GCP region. Automated, encrypted backups are performed daily and retained per our data retention policy. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) definitions stored in GitHub enable rapid restoration of full environments. Monitoring via third party tools independent of the underlying infrastructure are employed for rapid visibility into outages.

            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              We maintain a continuous security monitoring and compliance program aligned with SOC 2 and ISO 27001 principles. Our controls are regularly validated through automated security posture checks in GCP (via Security Command Center and policy-as-code scans), infrastructure code reviews with required approvals in GitHub, vulnerability scanning and reporting, internal compliance reviews, and tabletop incident response exercises. Results are tracked and remediations are logged and verified in our issue management system.

            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              All system access is tied to Google Workspace-managed identities with SSO and MFA. Administrative access to GCP and GitHub is restricted to authorized personnel using least privilege and just-in-time (JIT) access principles. Kubernetes cluster and database credentials are stored as Google Secret Manager secrets, encrypted and rotated regularly. Changes to production systems require approval through GitHub pull request (PR) reviews and are automatically deployed through a controlled CI/CD pipeline.

            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base mb-2">Protecting Customer Personal Data during transmission (in transit)</h5>
            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              All data transmitted between users, services, and cloud components is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2+. Internal GCP and Kubernetes network communications also enforce mTLS or Google’s internal encryption standards for inter-service traffic. External access endpoints (API, web app) are protected via Cloudflare TLS termination and HSTS headers to prevent downgrade or man-in-the-middle attacks.

            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base mb-2">Protecting Customer Personal Data during storage (at rest)</h5>
            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              All Customer Personal Data stored in databases, object storage, and backups is encrypted at rest. GCP’s default encryption is applied to all storage systems, and customer data never resides unencrypted on disk. Kubernetes secrets and persistent volumes are encrypted using Google-managed keys. Access to production data is restricted and logged; only authorized engineers with an operational need may access production environments.

            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base mb-2">Physical security where Customer Personal Data is processed</h5>
            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              All physical infrastructure is hosted in Google Cloud data centers, which implement robust physical security controls, including biometric access, 24/7 monitoring, and redundant power and network systems. No customer data is stored on local developer machines or offices.
            </p>

            <h5 class="font-semibold text-base mb-2">Events logging</h5>
            <p class="text-sm mb-4">
              System and access logs are centralized and retained in Google Cloud Logging, where they are tamper-resistant and immutable. Logs include authentication events, infrastructure changes, API access, and network flow data. Alerts are configured for anomalies or policy violations, and logs are periodically reviewed as part of our security monitoring and incident response processes.

              All infrastructure is provisioned declaratively via Infrastructure as Code (IaC) in GitHub, reviewed via mandatory PR approvals, and deployed through automated pipelines. Baseline configurations enforce secure defaults, including disabled public IPs for internal services, restricted ingress and egress rules, auto-updating managed Kubernetes nodes, GCP Organization Policies to prevent risky configurations, and configuration drift detection and policy checks run continuously to maintain compliance with internal standards.

The current list of Approved Subprocessors includes the identities of the Subprocessors, their country of location, and their anticipated Processing tasks. Provider will inform Customer at least 10 business days in advance and in writing of any intended changes to the Approved Subprocessors whether by addition or replacement of a Subprocessor, which allows Customer to have enough time to object to the changes before the Provider begins using the new Subprocessor(s). Provider will give Customer the information necessary to allow Customer to exercise its right to object to the change to Approved Subprocessors. Customer has 30 days after notice of a change to the Approved Subprocessors to object, otherwise Customer will be deemed to accept the changes. If Customer objects to the change within 30 days of notice, Customer and Provider will cooperate in good faith to resolve Customer's objection or concern.

In addition, Provider will share, at Customer's request, a copy of its agreements (including any amendments) with its Subprocessors.
