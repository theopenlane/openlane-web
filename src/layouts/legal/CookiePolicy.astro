          <p class="text-sm">
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data which may include an
            anonymous unique identifier. They are sent to your browser from a
            website and stored on your device. These small text files serve as a
            memory for websites, allowing them to:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-sm list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
            <li>Remember your login status and preferences</li>
            <li>Understand how you interact with the website</li>
            <li>
              Help provide you with a more personalized browsing experience
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-sm">
            When you visit a website, it may create a cookie and send it to your
            browser. Your browser then stores this cookie and sends it back to
            the website on subsequent visits. This process enables the website
            to recognize your device and remember your preferences over time.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm">
            Cookies are typically set to expire after a specific period, which
            can range from a few minutes to several years. They can only be read
            by the website that created them or, in some cases, by third-party
            services the website has authorized.
