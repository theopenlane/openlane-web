      {
        q: "Who needs to comply with GDPR?",
        a: "GDPR applies to any organization that processes personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located. This includes EU-based companies, international businesses serving EU customers, and data processors handling EU personal data on behalf of controllers.",

        q: "What is personal data under GDPR?",

        q: "What is the difference between a data controller and processor?",
        a: "A data controller determines the purposes and means of processing personal data, while a data processor processes data on behalf of the controller.

      {
        q: "When is a Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA) required?",

This includes systematic monitoring, large-scale processing of special category data, automated decision-making with legal effects, or processing of vulnerable individuals' data. DPIAs assess risks and mitigation measures.",
      },
      {
        q: "What are the breach notification requirements?",
        a: "Organizations must notify the relevant supervisory authority within 72 hours of becoming aware of a personal data breach, unless the breach is unlikely to result in risk to individuals. If the breach poses high risk to individuals, affected data subjects must also be notified without undue delay.",
