      {
        q: "What is Openlane?",
        a: "Openlane is affordable, transparent, developer-friendly compliance automation. We make compliance simple so you can actually ship code.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who is Openlane for?",
        a: "Openlane is optimized for growing teams. Our modular system and pricing are ideal for founders and developers in early-stage companies who don’t want to close deals and enter new markets -who need SOC 2 (or NIST, ISO27001, and more) without the tears.",
      },
      {
        q: "How is Openlane different?",
        a: "We’re open-source with transparent pricing. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, no “surprise” upcharges. Just compliance that plays nice.",
      },

  },
  {
    section: "Features",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Which frameworks do you support?",
        a: "We're starting with SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, and NIST 800-53, the greatest door-openers and deal-closers for growing companies. Don't see what you are looking for? We also support custom frameworks and can onboard new frameworks to our platform in days - instead of months.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it connect to my tools?",
        a: "Yes. We can connect to GitHub, AWS, GCP, Azure, Slack, and more. If your developers live in it, we probably plug into it -and if webhooks and API keys don't get you there, we can build together in the open.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I customize?",
        a: "Absolutely. Think of our templates like IKEA furniture -you can follow the instructions or hack it into something cooler.",
      },
      {
        q: "What’s “continuous compliance”?",
        a: "Instead of panicking once a year, you’re audit-ready every day. Like brushing your teeth, but for security.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I have to do continuous compliance to use Openlane?",
        a: "Of course not! Openlane is configurable to your level of automation and comfort. The truth is, some evidence is just easier to pull manually and drop into a portal -you're not stuck in a rigid environment with us.",
      },

    section: "Security & Data",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Is my data secure?",

      {
        q: "What if I leave?",
        a: "We won’t make it awkward. Download your data and any evidenec from our system and go along on your journey.",

        a: "Yep. Fork it, run it, star it. Pay us to make your lives easier and get access to licensed frameworks.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need a credit card to start?",
        a: "Nope. We’re not that clingy. Use our 30-day free trial to confirm we're a good fit, and stick with us for the long haul.",
      },
      {
        q: "How fast can I onboard?",
        a: "Hours. If it takes longer, ping us —we’ll race you.",

    section: "Audits",
    items: [
      {
        q: "Will it help me pass SOC 2?",
        a: "Yes. We automate the evidence so you can spend less time sweating and more time drilling into and solving your customers pain points.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I share with my auditor?",
        a: "Absolutely -and they would prefer it! Export it, send them a link, or let them poke around directly —you have granular control over what they see.",
      },
    ],

  {
    section: "Support",

      {
        q: "Do you offer support?",
        a: "Yep. Access free help from our community on discord, or contact us to talk about a paid plan if you want us on speed dial.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is there a community?",
        a: "Yes, and they’re as tired of compliance theater as you are. Come join the movement!",
