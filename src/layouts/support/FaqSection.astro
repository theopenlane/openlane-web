      {
        q: "Who’s it for?",
        a: "Everyone. From founders who don’t want to moonlight as auditors, engineers who hate spreadsheets, to larger teams that want SOC 2 without the tears and everyone in between.",
      },
      {
        q: "How’s it different?",
        a: "We’re open-source with transparent pricing. No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, no “surprise” upcharges. Just compliance that plays nice.",

        q: "Does it connect to my tools?",

        q: "Can I customize?",
        a: "Totally. Think of our templates like IKEA furniture—you can follow the instructions or hack it into something cooler.",

        q: "What’s “continuous compliance”?",

        q: "Can I share with my auditor?",
