const faqs = [
  {
    question: "Why do I even need a Trust Center?",
    answer:
      "Modern buyers expect transparency around security and compliance. A Trust Center gives them a single, self-serve place to review your security posture, reducing back-and-forth, shortening sales cycles, and helping you build trust early, especially as your company grows.",
  },
  {
    question: "What information is visible to external viewers?",
    answer:
      "Only the trust and security content you publish, including documents, policies, and compliance information.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we use it for multiple frameworks?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Share trust and compliance information across multiple frameworks from a single Trust Center.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this a replacement for security questionnaires?",
    answer:
      "It significantly reduces them. Most buyer questions are answered upfront, so fewer questionnaires hit your inbox.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do auditors use the same data?",
    answer:
      "No. Auditors work in your internal compliance workspace. The Trust Center is a curated, external-facing view.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does the Trust Center support custom branding and domains?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Customize branding and use your own domain so it looks like part of your product.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can we require an NDA before sharing sensitive documents?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can require an NDA before granting access to private documents, with optional approval workflows to control exactly who can view them.",
  },
