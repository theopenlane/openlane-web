name: Compliance
description: The practice of implementing and maintaining controls that meet external and internal requirements.
---

Compliance is the ongoing act of aligning an organization’s operations with laws, regulations, standards, and internal policies.

In practice, this means identifying applicable requirements, designing controls to meet them, gathering evidence that controls are working, and addressing gaps when they are found.

Compliance is most effective when it is integrated into everyday workflows rather than treated as an afterthought or purely audit-driven activity.
