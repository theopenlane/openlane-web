A system event is any occurrence that may affect how a system operates or whether it can meet its objectives.

Examples include hardware failures, unexpected reboots, or significant performance degradation. Some system events may also be security events if they involve unauthorized activity.

Monitoring and logging system events provides visibility into the health and behavior of critical services.
