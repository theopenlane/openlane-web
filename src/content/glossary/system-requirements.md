System requirements are detailed specifications for how a system must behave in order to meet commitments, comply with regulations, and support business objectives.

They can cover functional behavior, performance, security, compliance, and integration needs. Requirements are often documented in design docs, tickets, and policies.

Traceability from requirements to implementation, testing, and controls is valuable for both engineering quality and compliance.
