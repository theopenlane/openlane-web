A threat is a potential cause of an unwanted incident that may result in harm to systems, data, or people.

Threats can be intentional, such as malicious attacks, or unintentional, such as mistakes or natural disasters. Understanding threats is a key input into risk assessments.

Threat modeling and scenario analysis help organizations design controls to mitigate the most significant threats they face.
