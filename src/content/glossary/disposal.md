Disposal is the process of securely removing or destroying information that is no longer needed, or transforming it so it can no longer be linked to individuals.

Examples include securely wiping storage, shredding physical media, or applying anonymization techniques. Disposal should follow retention policies and legal or contractual requirements.

Proper disposal reduces the risk of old data being exposed in incidents or accessed in ways that no longer align with business needs or privacy commitments.
