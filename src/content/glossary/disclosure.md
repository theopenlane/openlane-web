Disclosure is the act of making information available to another party, whether by direct transfer, granting access, or other forms of sharing.

In privacy and security programs, disclosures are carefully controlled and documented. Organizations distinguish between appropriate disclosures, such as sharing data with a processor under contract, and unauthorized disclosures, which may represent incidents or breaches.

Policies and contracts help define when and how disclosures are allowed and what safeguards must be in place.
