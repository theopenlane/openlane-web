A process or control framework defines a set of processes or controls that organizations are expected to implement to achieve effective internal control.

These frameworks are often developed by regulators, industry groups, or standards bodies, and they provide a reference point for audits and assessments.

Security and privacy-focused frameworks help organizations design controls that meet common expectations and make it easier for customers and partners to understand their posture.
