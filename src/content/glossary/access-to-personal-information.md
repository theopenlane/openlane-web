Access to personal information is a core privacy principle. It refers to a person’s ability to view the information an organization stores about them and understand how that information is used, shared, and retained.

In many regulations, individuals also have the right to request corrections when information is inaccurate or incomplete. Practically, this is implemented through self-service portals, subject access request processes, and documented response timelines.

Strong access processes make it easier to demonstrate privacy compliance and build trust with customers by showing that they can see and influence how their data is handled.
