A vendor is a company or individual that supplies goods or services to an organization.

Vendors can range from cloud providers and SaaS platforms to consultants and service firms. Because vendors may affect security, availability, and compliance, they are usually part of third-party risk management programs.

Organizations often maintain vendor inventories, perform due diligence, and request security documentation such as SOC 2 reports.
