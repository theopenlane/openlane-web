name: Controls Convergence
description: The practice of consolidating overlapping controls across frameworks so they can be managed once and mapped many times.
---

Controls convergence focuses on reducing duplication by identifying where multiple frameworks require essentially the same control.

Rather than maintaining separate, slightly different controls for each framework, organizations define a single converged control and map it to many requirements.

Converged controls simplify operations, reduce confusion for control owners, and make it easier to show how one activity satisfies several external obligations.
