name: Automated Evidence
description: Evidence collected directly from systems by technical integrations instead of manual screenshots or exports.

Automated evidence is data that is pulled directly from systems via integrations, APIs, or scheduled jobs rather than gathered manually.

Examples include user lists pulled from an identity provider, configuration data from a cloud account, or vulnerability scan results fetched on a schedule. Automated evidence tends to be more reliable, less error-prone, and easier to keep up to date than screenshots or ad-hoc exports.

Using automation for evidence collection helps teams move from one-off audit projects to continuous readiness and reduces the burden on engineers and control owners.
