Open source software is software whose source code is publicly available and can be inspected, modified, and redistributed within the terms of its license.

Openlane follows an open-source-first approach, which can improve transparency, community contributions, and trust. At the same time, organizations must still manage supply chain and dependency risks when using open source.

Clear policies and processes for adopting and maintaining open-source components are an important part of secure development practices.
