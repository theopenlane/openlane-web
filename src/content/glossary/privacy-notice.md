A privacy notice explains to individuals how their personal information will be handled.

It typically covers what data is collected, the purposes for processing, how data is shared, how long it is retained, and what rights individuals have. It should also provide contact information for questions or complaints.

Well-written privacy notices are clear, accessible, and kept up to date as practices or regulations change.
