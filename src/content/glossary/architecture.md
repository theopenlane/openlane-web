name: Architecture
description: The overall design and structure of a system, including its components and how they interact.

Architecture describes how a system is structured: its components, the technologies used, and the way data and control flows between pieces.

In a compliance context, system architecture diagrams help explain how services are deployed, how data moves between components, and where security controls like authentication, encryption, and logging are applied.

Good documentation of architecture makes it easier to scope audits, reason about risk, and show auditors how your environment is put together.
