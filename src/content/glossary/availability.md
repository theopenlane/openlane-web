name: Availability
description: A Trust Services Criteria category focused on ensuring systems are reliably accessible for their intended use.
---

Availability is one of the Trust Services Criteria used in SOC 2. It focuses on whether a system is up and usable for its intended purpose within agreed expectations, such as SLAs or internal objectives.

Controls that support availability include redundancy, capacity planning, monitoring, incident response processes, and documented disaster recovery plans.

When companies include Availability in their SOC 2 scope, they commit to demonstrating how they design and operate their systems to minimize downtime and impact from outages.
