A compliance program is the long-term structure an organization uses to understand obligations, implement controls, collect evidence, and manage risk.

Instead of treating compliance as a one-time project, a program focuses on repeatable processes, defined ownership, and continuous improvement. It connects frameworks, controls, policies, and tasks into a coherent whole.

A strong compliance program becomes part of how the organization operates and supports growth by reducing surprises in sales, audits, and regulatory reviews.
