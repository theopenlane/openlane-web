The Trust Services Criteria (TSC) are the criteria published by the AICPA for evaluating controls in SOC 2 and related engagements.

The categories are Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy. Organizations choose which categories to include in scope and then design controls to meet the associated criteria.

Understanding the TSC is essential for building a SOC 2-ready control environment and mapping evidence to the right requirements.
