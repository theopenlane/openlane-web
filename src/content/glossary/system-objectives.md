System objectives describe what a system is meant to accomplish, including performance targets, reliability goals, and functional outcomes.

These objectives are often tied to commitments made to customers or internal stakeholders. They drive design decisions, control selection, and monitoring strategies.

Clearly defined objectives make it easier to evaluate whether a system and its controls are fit for purpose.
