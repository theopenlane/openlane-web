System boundaries describe what is included and excluded when you refer to a particular system.

They define which infrastructure, software, data, and processes are in scope for risk assessments, audits, and documentation. Good boundary definitions prevent confusion and scope creep.

System boundary diagrams and narratives are often part of SOC 2 system descriptions and internal documentation.
