A security incident is a security event (or series of events) that requires a response to protect information assets, systems, or people.

Incidents can include confirmed breaches, successful attacks, serious misconfigurations, or other situations that threaten confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations typically handle incidents under a documented incident response plan.

Good incident management includes detection, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned.
