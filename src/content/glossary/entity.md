An entity is a company, organization, or defined operating unit that has its own objectives, systems, and responsibilities.

In audits and compliance documentation, it’s important to be clear which entity is in scope. For example, a SOC 2 report typically covers a specific entity and the systems it operates.

Large organizations may define multiple entities based on legal structure, lines of business, or geography.
