description: A business model where products or services are sold directly to individual end users.
---

Business to Consumer (B2C) companies sell directly to individual customers. Examples include streaming services, consumer apps, and online retailers.

While B2C organizations may still pursue frameworks like SOC 2 or ISO 27001, they often focus heavily on privacy regulations, fraud prevention, and customer data protection at scale.

The compliance pressures and stakeholder expectations can differ from B2B markets, where enterprise customers routinely request formal audit reports and detailed security disclosures.
