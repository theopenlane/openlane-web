Cloud security compliance is the work of aligning cloud-hosted systems with relevant security and regulatory frameworks.

This often includes a mix of security-focused standards like ISO 27001 or NIST, and certification or regulatory programs such as SOC 2, FedRAMP, or industry-specific rules. Controls typically focus on identity, network security, configuration management, logging, and vulnerability management.

Because cloud environments change quickly, successful cloud security compliance usually relies on automation, infrastructure-as-code, and continuous monitoring instead of point-in-time configuration reviews.
