A Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) is a legal contract that defines how parties can use and share confidential information.

NDAs are common between companies and their vendors, partners, and potential customers. They set expectations around confidentiality, permitted uses, and how long obligations last.

Tracking and managing NDAs is an important part of third-party risk and customer relationship management.
