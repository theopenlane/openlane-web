Policies are formal statements from leadership that describe what should happen in specific areas such as security, privacy, or operations.

They set expectations and boundaries, and they serve as the basis for more detailed procedures. Examples include access control policies, change management policies, and incident response policies.

Auditors frequently review policies to understand how an organization intends to operate and to confirm that practices align with written expectations.
