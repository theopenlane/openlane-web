Contacts are people or organizations that an entity reaches out to—for example, for marketing, product updates, or system notifications.

Contact records might include email addresses, names, roles, and other metadata. They may be grouped into lists or segments based on consent, relationship, or communication preferences.

Managing contacts responsibly is important for privacy compliance, deliverability, and respecting the expectations of customers and prospects.
