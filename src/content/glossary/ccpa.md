The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) is a state privacy law that grants California residents specific rights over their personal information.

Key rights include the ability to know what data is collected, request deletion of certain data, opt out of the sale of personal information, and be free from discrimination for exercising these rights.

Businesses that meet CCPA thresholds must maintain clear notices, implement processes to respond to requests, and ensure their data practices align with the law’s requirements.
