Collection refers to how an organization obtains personal information, whether directly from individuals or from third parties such as partners or vendors.

Examples include sign-up forms, support interactions, payment flows, or data feeds from other services. Each collection mechanism should have a clear purpose, legal basis where required, and a way to inform individuals how their data will be used.

Well-documented collection practices make it easier to satisfy privacy requirements and explain data flows to auditors and customers.
