A board of directors is the governing group that provides oversight for an organization’s strategy, financial health, and major risks.

In the context of compliance and security, boards are often briefed on major risk areas, incident trends, and the status of critical certifications or regulatory obligations.

Clear communication with the board helps ensure that security and compliance programs have appropriate support, funding, and visibility.
