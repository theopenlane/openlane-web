Senior management is the group of executives and leaders responsible for executing an organization’s strategy and overseeing major functions.

They play a key role in setting tone at the top for security and compliance, allocating resources, and making decisions about risk tolerance and priorities.

Auditors and regulators often look for evidence that senior management is informed about key risks and supports control activities.
