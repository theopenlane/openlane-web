name: Issue
description: A realized risk or problem that has already occurred and requires attention.

An issue is a problem that has already materialized, often representing a risk that was not fully mitigated.

Examples include control failures, audit findings, or security gaps discovered during reviews. Issues are typically tracked, assigned owners, and remediated through structured plans.

Clear issue management processes ensure that problems are not only identified but also addressed and prevented from recurring.
