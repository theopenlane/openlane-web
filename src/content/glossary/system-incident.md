A system incident is a system event that rises to the level of needing active response from management or operations teams.

For example, an outage affecting customers, a data corruption event, or a major capacity issue could all be system incidents. Incident management processes help teams respond consistently and communicate clearly.

System incidents sometimes overlap with security incidents, but not all incidents are security-related.
