An Information Security Management System (ISMS) is a structured approach to managing information security risks.

It typically includes policies, procedures, defined roles, risk assessment and treatment processes, and mechanisms for continuous improvement. ISO 27001 is built around the concept of an ISMS.

Implementing an ISMS helps systematic integration of security into business processes and provides a strong foundation for certifications and external assessments.
