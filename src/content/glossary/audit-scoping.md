name: Audit Scoping
description: The process of defining what will be included in an audit, such as systems, time periods, and activities.
---

Audit scoping is the work of deciding what an audit will cover. This includes the systems, locations, teams, and time periods that fall within scope.

A clear scope helps avoid surprises during the audit and keeps the effort proportional to your goals. For example, a SOC 2 audit might be scoped to a specific product and hosting environment rather than every system the company operates.

Upfront alignment on scope with your auditor is critical to planning testing, evidence collection, and overall effort.
