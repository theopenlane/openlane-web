Business to Business (B2B) describes companies whose customers are other organizations instead of individual consumers.

B2B SaaS businesses often face complex security and compliance expectations from their customers, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, or data privacy requirements. These expectations frequently show up in security questionnaires, RFPs, and contract negotiations.

Openlane is designed with B2B SaaS companies in mind, where a strong compliance posture directly supports sales and customer trust.
