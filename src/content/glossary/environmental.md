Environmental risks are physical events or conditions that can damage systems or disrupt operations. Examples include fire, flood, power loss, or extreme weather.

Controls that address environmental risks might include redundant power, fire suppression systems, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery planning.

Even in cloud-hosted environments, organizations rely on data centers and infrastructure providers that implement extensive environmental controls.
