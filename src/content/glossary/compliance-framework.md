A compliance framework provides a structured way to think about requirements, controls, and evidence. It defines what “good” looks like for a given area such as security, privacy, or financial reporting.

Examples include SOC 2, ISO 27001, PCI DSS, HIPAA, and NIST 800-53. Organizations often adopt multiple frameworks and map controls across them to avoid duplicate work.

Using a framework gives teams common language, clear targets, and a baseline for audits and external assessments.
