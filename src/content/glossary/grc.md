name: Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)
description: An integrated approach for managing governance, risk management, and compliance across an organization.
---

Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) describes a coordinated approach to how an organization is directed, how risks are managed, and how obligations are met.

Rather than treating governance, risk, and compliance as separate silos, GRC practices tie them together so that decisions, controls, and reporting are aligned.

Many tools and frameworks exist to support GRC, but the underlying goal is better visibility and more coherent decision-making about how the organization operates.
