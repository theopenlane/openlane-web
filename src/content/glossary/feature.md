A feature is a distinct capability within a product that solves a particular problem or provides a concrete benefit to users.

Features can be made available to all customers or gated by plan, entitlements, or feature flags. In complex products, mapping features to controls and evidence can help answer questions like “which parts of the product are in scope for this framework?”

In customer-facing security reviews, explaining which features support specific compliance goals can make your value proposition clearer.
