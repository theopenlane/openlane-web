The NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) is a set of guidelines that help organizations manage cybersecurity risks.

It is built around five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Organizations can use the framework to assess their current practices, define target states, and plan improvements.

Many organizations adopt NIST CSF voluntarily, even when not required by regulation, to strengthen their security posture and align teams on priorities.
