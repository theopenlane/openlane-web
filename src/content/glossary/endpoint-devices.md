Endpoint devices are the laptops, desktops, mobile devices, and similar hardware or virtual machines that people use to access systems and data.

They are a common target for attacks, so organizations typically enforce controls like disk encryption, endpoint protection tools, patch management, and mobile device management (MDM).

Endpoint security is a key part of safeguarding access to production systems and sensitive data, especially in distributed and remote-first teams.
