Risk is the possibility that an event or condition will occur and adversely affect an organization’s objectives.

Risks are often described in terms of likelihood and impact. Examples include security breaches, system outages, or control failures. Managing risk means identifying, assessing, and treating these possibilities before they become issues.

Effective risk management ties risks to controls, owners, and mitigation plans and revisits them regularly.
