Integrity, in the context of SOC 2, refers to ensuring that data and system processing are accurate, complete, and authorized.

Controls that support integrity include input validation, reconciliation checks, approval workflows, and monitoring for unexpected changes. Loss of integrity can lead to incorrect decisions, financial misstatements, or security issues.

When Integrity is in scope for an audit, organizations must show how they detect and prevent unauthorized or erroneous changes to data and processing.
