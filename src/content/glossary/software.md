Software is the collection of programs, libraries, and related components that instruct computers and devices how to perform tasks.

It includes application software used directly by users and system software that supports underlying operations. In modern organizations, software is deeply intertwined with business processes and risk.

Secure development practices and lifecycle management of software are key elements of many compliance frameworks.
