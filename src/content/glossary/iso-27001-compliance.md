ISO 27001 compliance means that an organization has implemented an ISMS that meets the requirements of the ISO 27001 standard.

This includes defining scope, performing risk assessments, selecting and implementing controls, and operating the system over time. Organizations may seek certification from accredited bodies to provide external assurance.

ISO 27001 is widely used, especially in industries like finance and technology, as a benchmark for information security maturity.
