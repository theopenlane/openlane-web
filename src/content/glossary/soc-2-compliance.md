SOC 2 compliance means designing and operating controls that meet the SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria and having those controls examined by a licensed CPA firm.

SOC 2 reports are widely requested by customers of SaaS and technology companies as proof that data is handled securely and reliably. Organizations can scope their report to one or more categories, such as Security, Availability, or Confidentiality.

Preparing for SOC 2 typically involves establishing a compliance program, mapping controls, collecting evidence, and operating processes over an observation period.
