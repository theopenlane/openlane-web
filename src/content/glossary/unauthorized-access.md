Unauthorized access occurs when a person or system gains access to data or resources without appropriate approval.

This can result from compromised credentials, misconfigurations, or bypassed controls. Unauthorized access can affect confidentiality, integrity, or availability and often triggers incident response.

Access controls, monitoring, and regular reviews help prevent and detect unauthorized access.
