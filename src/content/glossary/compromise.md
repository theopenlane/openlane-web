A compromise occurs when the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or systems is harmed or at serious risk.

Examples include unauthorized access to data, data corruption, or disruptions that prevent a system from functioning correctly. Compromises can arise from attacks, accidents, or system failures.

Incident response and monitoring programs aim to detect potential compromises quickly, limit impact, and restore normal operations.
