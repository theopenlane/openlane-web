Privacy commitments are the promises an organization makes about how it collects, uses, shares, and retains personal information.

They may appear in privacy notices, contracts, data processing agreements, or trust center content. Once made, these commitments become part of what regulators, customers, and auditors expect the organization to honor.

Maintaining alignment between actual practices and privacy commitments is essential for avoiding regulatory and contractual issues.
