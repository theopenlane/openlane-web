Risk response is how an organization chooses to handle a specific risk.

Common responses include accepting the risk, avoiding it by changing plans, reducing it through controls, or sharing it with another party, such as through insurance or outsourcing.

Recording chosen responses, along with rationale and supporting controls, makes risk management transparent and auditable.
