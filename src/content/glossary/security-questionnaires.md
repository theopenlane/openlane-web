Security questionnaires are structured question sets used to gather information about security practices.

They are commonly used during vendor evaluations, customer due diligence, and internal risk assessments. Questionnaires may cover topics such as access control, incident response, encryption, and certifications.

While necessary, questionnaires can be time-consuming, which is why many organizations seek ways to reuse answers or provide standardized trust center content.
