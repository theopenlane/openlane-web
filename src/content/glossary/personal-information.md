Personal information is any data that is about, or can be linked to, an identifiable person.

Depending on the regulation, this can include names, contact details, identifiers, and even behavioral or device information. Different laws use slightly different terms, such as personal data or personally identifiable information (PII).

Handling personal information responsibly requires clear purposes, appropriate safeguards, and alignment with privacy commitments and legal requirements.
