A service provider is a vendor that delivers services which may be integral to an organization’s operations, such as hosting, payment processing, or identity management.

Because service providers can affect security and compliance posture, organizations perform due diligence, maintain contracts, and sometimes rely on the provider’s audit reports.

Managing service providers is a central part of third-party risk management programs.
