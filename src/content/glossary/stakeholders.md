Stakeholders are people or groups who are affected by an organization’s actions or have a meaningful interest in its performance.

Examples include customers, employees, shareholders, regulators, partners, and the communities where a company operates. Different stakeholders may care about different aspects of security, privacy, and compliance.

Understanding stakeholder expectations helps shape which frameworks to adopt, how to communicate about risk, and where to focus improvements.
