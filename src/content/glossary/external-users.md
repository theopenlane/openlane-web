External users are individuals or organizations outside the entity’s workforce who are allowed to access its systems or data.

Examples include customers, partners, and contractors. External access typically carries stricter controls and monitoring due to differing trust assumptions and legal relationships.

Clear onboarding, access provisioning, and offboarding processes for external users help manage security and compliance risks.
