Infrastructure refers to the underlying hardware and virtual resources that support applications and services.

This includes servers, storage, networking equipment, and cloud infrastructure components. Infrastructure design and configuration have a direct impact on security, availability, and performance.

In cloud environments, much of the physical infrastructure is managed by providers, but customers are still responsible for how they configure and use those building blocks.
