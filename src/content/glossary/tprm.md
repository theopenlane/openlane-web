Third Party Risk Management (TPRM) focuses on understanding and managing risks that arise from vendors, partners, and other external parties.

Activities include due diligence, contract reviews, security questionnaires, ongoing monitoring, and exit planning. TPRM programs often prioritize third parties based on criticality and data access.

Strong TPRM is increasingly important as organizations rely on a growing ecosystem of cloud services and specialized providers.
