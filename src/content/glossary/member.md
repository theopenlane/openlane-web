A member is someone who has been granted access to manage or participate in an organization’s workspace.

Members may have different roles, such as administrators, contributors, or read-only users. Managing member access is a core part of access control and user lifecycle management.

Regular reviews of member lists help ensure that only appropriate people have access to sensitive systems and data.
