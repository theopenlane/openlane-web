Retention refers to how long information is stored and accessible for use.

Retention periods are influenced by legal requirements, contractual obligations, and business needs. Too-short retention may disrupt operations, while overly long retention can increase risk and cost.

Retention policies and schedules help ensure that data is kept for the right amount of time and then disposed of appropriately.
