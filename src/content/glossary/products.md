Products are the goods or services an organization offers to its customers. In SaaS, products are typically software services offered on a subscription basis.

Compliance programs often need to distinguish between products that are in scope for a framework and those that are not, based on where data flows and what customers rely on.

Clear product definitions support accurate scoping for audits, security reviews, and customer communications.
