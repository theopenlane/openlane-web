A group is a set of users that are managed together, often based on company, role, team, or subscription tier.

Groups make it easier to apply consistent access policies or product entitlements without configuring each user individually. In multi-tenant systems, groups can also represent customer organizations.

Well-designed group structures simplify provisioning, permissions reviews, and audit evidence for access controls.
