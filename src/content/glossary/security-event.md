A security event is any observable occurrence that may be relevant to the security of systems or data.

Examples include suspicious logins, failed authentication attempts, malware detections, or unusual configuration changes. Not every security event is an incident, but events are often what detection and monitoring tools surface.

Security teams analyze events to determine which ones represent actual incidents requiring response.
