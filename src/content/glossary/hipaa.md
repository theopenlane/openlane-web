HIPAA is a United States law that sets requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information (PHI).

It defines administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for entities that handle PHI, including healthcare providers, plans, and many of their vendors. Non-compliance can lead to significant fines and contractual consequences.

Organizations that work in or around healthcare often pair HIPAA requirements with security frameworks or certifications to show customers they handle PHI appropriately.
