Commitments are the statements an organization makes to customers and stakeholders about how it will operate. These can appear in contracts, SLAs, security pages, or public documentation.

Examples include uptime guarantees, data handling promises, and commitments to specific security practices. In SOC reporting, commitments help define what a system is expected to do and what auditors evaluate against.

Clear, realistic commitments reduce ambiguity, support customer trust, and provide a concrete reference for compliance programs.
