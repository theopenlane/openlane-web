Openlane now supports additional compliance frameworks: FedRAMP Moderate and ISO 42001.

Organizations operating in regulated or AI-governed environments can now map controls, track evidence, and structure programs aligned to these standards directly within Openlane.

Framework support remains modular — teams can enable only what they need and manage multiple frameworks in parallel without duplicating work.
