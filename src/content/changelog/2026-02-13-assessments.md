Assessments are now available in Openlane.

Teams can create structured assessments tied to controls and frameworks, assign ownership, collect responses, and track progress over time.

Assessments help operationalize compliance work - whether you’re preparing for an audit, reviewing vendor risk, or validating internal controls. Responses are connected directly to your program, reducing duplicate work and improving visibility across stakeholders.
