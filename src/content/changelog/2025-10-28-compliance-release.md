Today we’re launching the Openlane Compliance Module — the foundation for building and managing a structured, sustainable compliance program.

This release introduces controls, programs, evidence tracking, framework mapping, and organizational scoping. Openlane now supports SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI DSS, ISO 27001, NIST CSF, NIST 800-53, and GDPR, allowing teams to manage one or multiple frameworks in a single, connected system without duplicating work.

The Compliance Module is built on top of Openlane’s core security and identity architecture, including:

- Authentication via SSO, social login, passkeys, and traditional credentials
- Support for SSO integrations and MFA enforcement
- Fine-grained permissions
- Group-based access controls
- and more

Compliance is ongoing work, not a point-in-time report, and this module is designed to support the real structure behind your program.
