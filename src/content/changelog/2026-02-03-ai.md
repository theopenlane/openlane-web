We’re launching Openlane’s first AI-powered workflows.

Teams can now generate draft policies and get information about controls directly within their compliance program. The goal isn’t to replace expertise and customization, it’s to remove the friction of starting from a blank page and get first-time users with a good starting point.

AI-generated content is contextual to your organization’s structure and always editable, giving you a strong starting point without sacrificing control.
