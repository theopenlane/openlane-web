We’ve expanded Single Sign-On (SSO) support in Openlane.

In addition to existing providers — GitHub, Google Workspace, Okta, OneLogin, and Slack — organizations can now connect Microsoft Entra ID or any Generic OIDC provider.

This gives teams more flexibility to integrate Openlane with their existing identity infrastructure while maintaining centralized authentication and access controls.
