Openlane now includes a unified Registry for tracking vendors, assets, and personnel.

The Registry provides a centralized source of truth for the entities that power your compliance program. Teams can document vendor relationships, associate assets with controls and frameworks, and manage personnel records, all directly connected to evidence and assessments within Openlane.

By linking vendors, systems, and people to your controls and workflows, the registry reduces duplication, improves visibility, and ensures your compliance program reflects how your organization actually operates.
